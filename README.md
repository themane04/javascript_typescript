# JavaScript / TypeScript / Docker Exercises

## Overview

This repository contains all the exercises we've tackled in our company. We embarked on our journey with basic JavaScript exercises, gradually transitioning to TypeScript and React. The module was not only educational but also significantly motivating, paving the way for my increased interest and future work with TypeScript and React.

### JavaScript Exercises

The initial phase of our learning path involved mastering fundamental JavaScript concepts and syntax. These exercises covered a wide array of topics, from variable declarations and control structures to functions and event handling.

### TypeScript Transition

Building on our JavaScript foundations, we shifted our focus to TypeScript. This transition allowed us to explore static typing, interfaces, and advanced types, enhancing code reliability and maintainability.

### React Integration

Incorporating React into our exercises, we delved into component-based architecture, state management, and the creation of interactive user interfaces. This phase underscored the power and efficiency of building web applications with React.

### Docker Utilization

To complement our front-end development exercises, we introduced Docker. This addition familiarized us with containerization, facilitating a consistent development environment for our TypeScript and React projects.

## Future Directions

This module has been a cornerstone in my development journey, instilling a profound interest in TypeScript and React. I look forward to further exploring these technologies and integrating them into future projects.
